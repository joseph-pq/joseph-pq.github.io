While polysomnography (PSG) remains the gold standard, photoplethysmography (PPG) is more practical due to its afford-ability and widespread use in wearable devices. However, state-of-the-art sleep staging methods often require prolonged continuous signal acquisition, making them impractical for wearable devices due to high energy consumption. Shorter signal acquisitions are more feasible but less accurate. Our work proposes an adapted sleep staging model based on top-performing state-of-the-art methods and evaluates its performance with different PPG segment sizes. We concatenate 30-second PPG segments over 15-minute intervals to leverage longer segment contexts. This approach achieved an accuracy of 0.75, a Cohen's Kappa of 0.60, an F1-Weighted score of 0.74, and an F1-Macro score of 0.60. Although reducing segment size decreased sensitivity for deep and REM stages, our strategy outperformed single 30-second window methods, particularly for these stages.</p>"},{"location":"blog/","title":"Blog","text":""},{"location":"blog/2024/09/21/securing-your-android-phone/","title":"Securing your Android phone","text":"<p>There are two main thougts recurrent in my mind when I think about security in my phone:</p> <ul> <li>What if some hacker attempts to steal my data?</li> <li>What if I lose my phone? or someone steals it?</li> </ul> <p>Probably, you have thought about these questions too.

If you have been leaked, change your password immediately. Actually, you should change your password periodically.

You can use a password manager to store your passwords and use them when you need to log in to a website or an app. The main advantage is that you don't need to remember all your passwords. Thus, you can use strong and different passwords for each account. Strong becuase it's hard to guess and different because if someone steals your password, they won't be able to access all your accounts.
